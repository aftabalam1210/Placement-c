struct////////////union

1)Struct is the collection of predefined data type.

syntax::: struct  structurename {
    members;members can be data type variable.
    //members cant be initialize;for eg int roll=2 not allowd.
    //members are private to the structure.
};

4) structure cant have the function.
5)structure can refere itself.
6)since  members are wrapped in a structure it can be accessed    only by the referensing the dot or arrow.->
eg;
struct student s;
s.rollno= 101;



struct student *s1;
s1->rollno=1;
